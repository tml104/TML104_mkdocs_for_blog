## What is Character Animation

## 3D CA

- simulation
  - fluid, smoke, sound...

- character animation


## Why Study

- 大量的joint

## Character Animation pipeline

- 骨骼套着皮套运动
- keyframe-based/kinematic approach：直接改变人的姿态
- physics-based/dynamic approaches：

## Keyframe animation

- disney's 12 principles
- forward/inverse kinematics
- key inerpolation
- motion capture
- motion retargeting：动补重计算
- motion graphs/ state machines：动作图，状态机
- motion matchingx
- generative models
- cross-modal motion synthesis

## Physics-based dynamic approaches

- 通过物理仿真
- 关节力矩
- spacetime/ trajectory optimization：轨迹优化方法
- abstract models
- DRL-based Tracking controllers
- hierarchical controllers
- generative control policies
-
